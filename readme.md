# Anagrams by cyber-dojo
* This is part of my practice of exercises provided by the book _Agile Technical Practices Distilled_

Write a program to generate all potential anagrams of an input string.

For example, the potential anagrams of biro are:
* `biro bior brio broi boir bori`
* `ibro ibor irbo irob iobr iorb`
* `rbio rboi ribo riob roib robi`
* `obir obri oirbr oirb orbi orib`
